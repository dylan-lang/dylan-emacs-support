;;; dime-compat.el --- compatibility functions for DIME in Emacs 24.1

;; Author: Tom Emerson (tremerson@gmail.com)
;; No copyright. Do whatever you want with it.

;; This file defines compatibility mappings between cl-* functions that
;; were introduced in Emacs 24.3. When required in dime.el these allow
;; dylan-mode/DIME to load/compile in Emacs 24.1, but there are still
;; issues with the dwank communication.

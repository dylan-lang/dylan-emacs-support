;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides three Emacs modes for the Dylan programming
;; language:

;; * The `dylan-mode` major mode to edit Dylan code.
;; * The `dylan-opt-mode` minor mode to show compiler optimizations.
;; * The `dylan-lid-mode` major mode to edit LID files.

;;; Code:

;; Testing
;;
;; dylan-test.dylan contains Dylan code that is indented in the preferred way. One
;; way to test this code is to open that file and press Tab on each line, or on the
;; specific lines you're trying to affect.

;; Debugging
;;
;; So far I (cgay) have found it easiest to debug by adding calls to
;; (message ...) all over the place and keep the *Messages* window
;; visible, since tracing doesn't say the names of the arguments or
;; return values. If someone else knows a better way please comment.
;;
;; With so many cascading defvars and the fact that eval-buffer doesn't reset
;; their values, frequently the easiest way to test changes is to start a new
;; Emacs.

;;; Customization:

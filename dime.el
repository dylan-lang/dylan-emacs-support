;;;; Commentary
;;
;; This file contains extensions for programming in Common Dylan. The
;; main features are:
;;
;;   A socket-based communication/RPC interface between Emacs and
;;   Dylan, enabling introspection and remote development.
;;
;;   The `dime-mode' minor-mode complementing `dylan-mode'. This new
;;   mode includes many commands for interacting with the Common Dylan
;;   process.
;;
;;   A Common Dylan debugger written in Emacs Dylan. The debugger pops up
;;   an Emacs buffer similar to the Emacs/Edylan debugger.
;;
;;   A Common Dylan inspector to interactively look at run-time data.
;;
;;   Trapping compiler messages and creating annotations in the source
;;   file on the appropriate forms.
;;
;; DIME requires Emacs 24.
;;
;; In order to run DIME, a supporting Dylan server called Swank is
;; required. Swank is distributed with dime.el and will automatically
;; be started in a normal installation.


;;;; Dependencies and setup

;; check that we have at least Emacs 24... full DIME support is only
;; available in 24.3, but dime-compat lets dylan-mode work in 24.1.

;;;; Connections
;;;
;;; "Connections" are the high-level Emacs<->Dylan networking concept.
;;;
;;; Emacs has a connection to each Dylan process that it's interacting
;;; with. Typically there would only be one, but a user can choose to
;;; connect to many Dylans simultaneously.
;;;
;;; A connection consists of a control socket, optionally an extra
;;; socket dedicated to receiving Dylan output (an optimization), and a
;;; set of connection-local state variables.
;;;
;;; The state variables are stored as buffer-local variables in the
;;; control socket's process-buffer and are used via accessor
;;; functions. These variables include things like the *FEATURES* list
;;; and Unix Pid of the Dylan process.
;;;
;;; One connection is "current" at any given time. This is:
;;;   `dime-dispatching-connection' if dynamically bound, or
;;;   `dime-buffer-connection' if this is set buffer-local, or
;;;   `dime-default-connection' otherwise.
;;;
;;; When you're invoking commands in your source files you'll be using
;;; `dime-default-connection'. This connection can be interactively
;;; reassigned via the connection-list buffer.
;;;
;;; When a command creates a new buffer it will set
;;; `dime-buffer-connection' so that commands in the new buffer will
;;; use the connection that the buffer originated from. For example,
;;; the apropos command creates the *Apropos* buffer and any command
;;; in that buffer (e.g. `M-.') will go to the same Dylan that did the
;;; apropos search. REPL buffers are similarly tied to their
;;; respective connections.
;;;
;;; When Emacs is dispatching some network message that arrived from a
;;; connection it will dynamically bind `dime-dispatching-connection'
;;; so that the event will be processed in the context of that
;;; connection.
;;;
;;; This is mostly transparent. The user should be aware that he can
;;; set the default connection to pick which Dylan handles commands in
;;; Dylan-mode source buffers, and dime hackers should be aware that
;;; they can tie a buffer to a specific connection. The rest takes
;;; care of itself.

;;;; Communication protocol

;;;;; Emacs Dylan programming interface
;;;
;;; The programming interface for writing Emacs commands is based on
;;; remote procedure calls (RPCs). The basic operation is to ask Dylan
;;; to apply a named Dylan function to some arguments, then to do
;;; something with the result.
;;;
;;; Requests can be either synchronous (blocking) or asynchronous
;;; (with the result passed to a callback/continuation function).  If
;;; an error occurs during the request then the debugger is entered
;;; before the result arrives -- for synchronous evaluations this
;;; requires a recursive edit.
;;;
;;; You should use asynchronous evaluations (`dime-eval-async') for
;;; most things. Reserve synchronous evaluations (`dime-eval') for
;;; the cases where blocking Emacs is really appropriate (like
;;; completion) and that shouldn't trigger errors (e.g. not evaluate
;;; user-entered code).
;;;
;;; We have the concept of the "current Dylan project". RPC requests
;;; always say what project the user is making them from and the Dylan
;;; side binds that project to *BUFFER-PROJECT* to use as it sees
;;; fit. The current project is defined as the buffer-local value of
;;; `dime-buffer-project' if set, and otherwise the project found in
;;;; a local lid file.
;;;
;;; Similarly we have the concept of the current thread, i.e. which
;;; thread in the Dylan process should handle the request. The current
;;; thread is determined solely by the buffer-local value of
;;; `dime-current-thread'. This is usually bound to t meaning "no
;;; particular thread", but can also be used to nominate a specific
;;; thread. The REPL and the debugger both use this feature to deal
;;; with specific threads.

(defvar-local dime-current-thread t
   "The id of the current thread on the Dylan side.
t means the \"current\" thread;
:repl-thread the thread that executes REPL requests;
fixnum a specific thread.")

This is set only in buffers bound to specific projects.")

;;; you need to, but the others are usually more convenient.

the Dylan image), and is thus easily tricked to modify the wrong
source files---which can lead to quite some stressfull cursing.

If this variable is T, a warning message is issued to raise the

different source root that also exists in the source root
directory of the user's current buffer.

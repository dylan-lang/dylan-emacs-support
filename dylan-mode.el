;;; Commentary:

;; Dylan mode is a major mode for editing Dylan programs. It provides
;; indenting and font-lock support.
;;
;; Bug reports should be sent to <gd-bugs@gwydiondylan.org>; questions,
;; comments and suggestions are welcome at <gd-hackers@gwydiondylan.org>.
;; Also, see http://www.gwydiondylan.org/ for updates and documentation. 
;;
;; Known limitations:
;;   Limited support for block (i.e. "/*") comments
;;     TAB indentation doesn't work within "/*" comments
;;   Magic => support doesn't work at end of buffer
;;
;; Desired features:
;;   Copy indentation from first statement in body
;;   Delete-backward-expanding-tabs
;;   More consistency in font-lock highlighting
;;   Better support for "/*" comments

;; History:
;;   version 0.1: Quick one day hack -- appears to be useful
;;   version 0.2: Added font lock support
;;   version 0.3: Added misc features to work towards "industrial strength"
;;     Detects "continuation lines" and indents them specially
;;     Basic comment support
;;     Added "symbol character" support (with second syntax table for
;;     indentation and font-lock)
;;     Added indentation support for "elseif" and "exception" clauses
;;     Cleaned up a number of old bugs
;;   version 0.4: Brought into compliance with new "post-DN22" syntax
;;     new comment syntax
;;     new "return types" syntax
;;     accepts sealed, open, concrete, and abstract in class definitions
;;     fixed bug in comment indentation
;;     fine tune font-lock-regexps for "define ..."
;;   version 0.5:
;;     Added "dylan-insert-block-end" function.
;;     Fixed bug in short circuiting indentation outside top level forms.
;;   version 1.0:
;;     Major code reorganization
;;     Added full case statement support
;;     Fixed "continuations" at top level
;;     Added "beginning-of-form" and "end-of-form" commands
;;     Fixed support for character literals and for "quoted" quote chars
;;   version 1.1:
;;     The "font-lock-mode" support no longer interferes with other language
;;     modes.   (Thanks to emg@hip.atr.co.jp)
;;   version 1.2:
;;     Fixes for various bugs (thanks to wlott@cs.cmu.edu):
;;       "foo-end;" was mistaken for the end of a compound statement
;;       syntax tables sometimes ended in an odd state after errors
;;       indentation sometimes failed if parens weren't balanced
;;   version 1.3:
;;     Added font lock support for "sealed", "open", etc.
;;   version 1.4:
;;     Added special-case support for generic function "continuations" and
;;     for outdenting "=>" in function definitions.
;;   version 1.5:
;;     Adjusted regexps to accept "primary" and "free" adjectives
;;     Mentioned dylan-outdent-arrows in the documentation
;;     Added a space to comment-start
;;   version 1.6:
;;     Fixed bug in generic function continuations from 1.4.
;;   version 1.7:
;;     Merged changes from Joseph Wilson (jnw@cis.ufl.edu) to facilitate use 
;;     within more general modes.
;;   version 1.8:
;;     Font lock fix for XEmacs from John Shen <jshen@cas.org>.
;;   version 1.9:
;;     Fixed bug in indentation for expressions in square and curly braces.
;;     Generalized modifier-word handling for definitions.
;;     Generalized 'define words' lists for easier extension.
;;     Fixed "exceeded max nesting" bug with long lists of items.
;;     Added switches for font-lock highlighting of functions and definition 
;;     sites.
;;   version 1.10:
;;     Fixed bug in "," reindent code.  It couldn't deal with commas
;;     in the middle of strings.
;;   version 1.11 12/13/95 by David N. Gray <gray@harlequin.com>:
;;     Add C-M-a and C-M-e for beginning and end of definition.
;;     Fix font lock syntax table for XEmacs.
;;   version 1.12:
;;     Added support for "define function"
;;     Fixed to ignore keywords in the file header.
;;     Do not require ";" after return value (contributed by
;;     gray@harlequin.com)
;;     fixed various bugs resulting from overzealous acceptance of newlines:
;;       the word "end" at the end of a comment line caused bad indentation
;;       empty module and library definitions did strange things.
;;   version 1.13:
;;     Fixed dylan-insert-block-end to handle "define function" properly.
;;     (Hopefully) fixed bug in indenting function result declarations,
;;     which was introduced by the previous round of fixes.
;;   version 1.14:
;;     Modified to use font-lock-syntax-table if it is defined.  This
;;     eliminates the need to use unportable constructs to modify the
;;     behavior of font-lock mode -- thus, fontification should now be
;;     reliable on modern EMACSen.
;;   version 1.15
;;     Fixed syntax table bugs which primarily affected gnu-emacs
;;     19.[23] users.  
;;     Optimized "beyond-dylan-header".  
;;     Removed new-lines from various font-lock regexps so that
;;     adjacent declarations aren't glommed together.
;;   version 1.16
;;     Made symbols properly fontify as strings.
;;     Added the dylan-no-highlights-in-header variable (enabled by
;;     default) which keeps keywords in headers from being treated
;;     specially.
;;   adjusted 12/6/96 by David N. Gray to set dylan-no-highlights-in-header
;;     only for Emacs 19.31 or later
;;   Modified 7/19/98 by David N. Gray to indent bodies of "with-..." macros.
;;   Modified 16 Jan 99 by Eric M. Kidd for C-FFI macros.
;;   version 1.17
;;     Various fixes and changes over quite some time by Chris Page.
;;     Retroactively bumped the version number after noticing that it
;;     had been left at 1.16 far too long.
;;   version 1.18
;;     Changed some user-modifiable variables to Customization
;;     variables and defined a Dylan customization group. Other
;;     miscellaneous fixes and changes.
;;   version 1.19
;;     Added fontification of the Dylan interchange file header.
;;     Other miscellaneous fixes and cleanups.
;;   version 1.20
;;     Added support for multiple levels of font-lock decoration.
;;   version 1.21
;;     Removed dylan-outdent-arrows. It should always be on.
